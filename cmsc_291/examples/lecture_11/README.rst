Baltimore City 311 Request Data Exploration
===========================================

To get started, make sure you install these three libraries::

    $> pip install pandas jupyterlab seaborn folium

Next you'll want to start up the `Jupyter Lab <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ webserver::

    $> jupyter lab --config="jupyter_notebook_config.py"

When you do this, JupyterLab will open automatically in your browser.
