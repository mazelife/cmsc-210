<h1>Assignment 2</h1>
<h2>Grittify</h2>
<hr>
<p><strong>Due Date</strong>: Wednesday, March 2nd, 11:59:59 PM
<p><strong>Value</strong>: 150 points<br>
<p><strong>Github Classroom Assignment Invite Link</strong>: <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/4pXslF-M">https://classroom.github.com/a/4pXslF-M</a></p>
<p><strong>Github</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/umbc-cmsc-210-spring-2022/cmsc-210-spring-2022-assignment-2">https://github.com/umbc-cmsc-210-spring-2022/cmsc-210-spring-2022-assignment-2</a></p>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong>: For Assignment 2, <em>collaboration is not allowed</em>; you must work individually. You may still see your TA and come to office hours for help, but you may not work with any other CMSC 210 students. You may post questions on Slack, <strong>but you may not post code</strong>.</p>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>To practice submitting assignments through Github classroom</li>
    <li>To practice basic object oriented programming</li>
    <li>To learn how to join sets of data together</li>
    <li>To become familiar with CMSC 210 Python coding standards</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>Comments &amp; Coding Standards</h3>
<ul>
        <li>Include a complete file header comment at the top of your file.</li>
        <li>Include a complete function header comment at the top of each function, just below the function header.</li>
        <li>Make sure to follow the CMSC 210 Coding Standards.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Task</h3>
<p> <img src="images/deadmau5.jpeg" style="float: right; margin-right: 20px" width="320">A TA from ages now long-past has harvested information about songs and albums from the artist <a href="https://deadmau5.com/">deadmau5</a>, who appears to be some sort of folk-singer.
The course staff and UMBC in no way endorse the artist deadmau5 or his views or opinions.  The course staff in no way endorses the death of mice.
The goal of your project is to write a command line tool, <code>grittify</code>, which will answer queries about songs of deadmau5. </p>

<h3>The Data</h3>
<p>You will be provided with the following csv files:
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/umbc-cmsc-210-spring-2022/cmsc-210-spring-2022-assignment-2/blob/main/deadmau5_albums.csv">deadmau5_albums.csv</a>: each row of the file is an album by deadmau5</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/umbc-cmsc-210-spring-2022/cmsc-210-spring-2022-assignment-2/blob/main/deadmau5_tracks.csv">deadmau5_tracks.csv</a>: each row of the file is a song by deadmau5</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Pre-defined Python Library Usage</h3>
<p>You may import <em>anything</em>.  At all. May the force of all of Python be with you.</p>
<p>We recommend that you use:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html">csv</a>: This library lets you read in csv files with ease.</li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html">datetime</a>: This library makes date math way way easier.</li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html">argparse</a>: Parser for command-line arguments</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Command line Functionality</h3>
<p>You are writing the command grittify which takes a command and then parameter(s).  The acceptable commands are:</p>
<pre><code>grittify album [album-name]</code></pre>
<p>Prints all of the songs on the album with <code>[album-name]</code></p>
<pre><code>grittify albums</code></pre>
<p>Prints all of the albums (but not their songs)</p>
<pre><code>grittify song [song-name]</code></pre>
<p>Prints the data for song with [song-name]  This is <strong>optional</strong>, I didn't provide code</p>
<pre><code>grittify songs</code></pre>
<p>Prints all of the data for all of the songs, including the data for the album they are on</p>
<pre><code>grittify songs after [date]</code></pre>
<p>Prints all songs that occur after a particular date, which will be written in <code>MM-DD-YYYY</code> format.  Album data will be included.</p>
<pre><code>grittify songs before [date]</code></pre>
<p>Prints all songs that occur before a particular date, which will be written in <code>MM-DD-YYYY</code> format.  Album data will be included.</p>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<p>The sample output is available as a separate file in your project template.</p>
<h3>Additional requirements</h3>
<p>You MUST NOT modify any of the supplied code, except for the contents of <code>get_all_albums()</code></p>
<p>Your output should be as close as possible to the sample outputs, though you can have a different order.  This includes printing dates as they are in the sample output.</p>

<h3>Submitting Your Assignment</h3>
<p>We will cover the use of github in class and provide walkthroughs for submitting assignments.</p>
