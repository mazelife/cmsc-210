<h1>Assignment 5</h1>
<h2>Modifying Django Walkthrough</h2>
<hr>
<img src="images/django-pony-dark.png" width="500" style="float: right">
<p><strong>Due Date</strong>: Friday, <strike>November 20th</strike> November 27th, 11:59:59 PM
<p><strong>Value</strong>: 150 points<br>
<p><strong>Github Invite</strong>: <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/3pp2nuAn">Click Here</a></p>
<p><strong>Collaboration</strong>: For Assignment 5, <em>collaboration is not allowed</em>; you must work individually.
    You may still see your TA and come to office hours for help, but you may not work with any other CMSC 210 students. You may post questions on Discord, <strong>but you may not post code</strong>.</p>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Practicing interaction with a database in Django</li>
    <li>Reinforce web development concepts</li>
    <li>Propose a concept for a web application</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Your starting point for this assignment is the django tutorial you went through for assignment 4. In this assignment,
    we are going to update our web app so that users can add and remove questions and choices themselves (rather than going through the admin interface).
</p>
<p>Change your web app such that:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Each question has a "remove" button after it. Clicking that button will remove the question from the database and
        refresh the page (refreshing the page can be accomplished with a RedirectResponse)</li>
    <li>The page where your questions are listed should have a text field with a button.  Clicking the button will submit the form, adding a question with the text from the text field.</li>
    <li>Repeat this process for choices.  NOTE:  choices will be slightly more complex, because each choice must be associated with a question.</li>
    <li>Lastly, you will write a brief description of a website that you would like to make for assignment 6.
        You MAY work with other students on this part.
        Put your description of the website and the names of any collaborators in a file called
        <code>proposal.txt</code> in your assignment submission on Github.</li>
    <li>Your website should include some ability for users to interact with it (in other words, it should not be a <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/staticwebsite">static</a> site.</a>) </li>
    <li>Your website must be built with Django</li>
</ol>
<p>The length of your proposal should be relatively short&mdash;how would you describe what your website does to a
    friend that you are trying to get to use it?   Just the name of the website is insufficient.</p>

<p>As always, feel free to ask questions in Discord if you get stuck or stumped.</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>
<p><strike>You will be doing a 1:1 Google Hangout or Discord Session with your TA, TBD. You will then run your project and
    navigate around your sample web app, demonstrating that it works.  Don't worry! You will not be judged for any
    criteria beyond "does it work?" and "is this all the stuff covered in the tutorial?"</strike>
</p>
